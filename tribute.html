           S. Nambi Narayanan (born 12 December 1941)is an Indian aerospace engineer, who worked for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and contributed significantly to Indian space program by developing the Vikas rocket engine. He led the team which acquired technology from the French for the Vikas engine used in the first PSLV that India launched.As a senior official at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), he was in-charge of the cryogenics division.He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award, in March 2019.

In 1994, he was falsely implicated in an espionage case, arrested and physically tortured in custody.The charges against him were disproven by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in April 1996,and the Supreme Court of India stopped the Kerala government on technical grounds from continuing its investigation.In 2018, the Supreme Court, through the bench of Dipak Misra, awarded Narayanan a compensation of ₹50,00,000 (US$70,000). The Government of Kerala decided to give him a further ₹1.3 crore (~US$183,000).The film Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, based on his life, starring and directed by R Madhavan, was released in July 2022.
       On 14 September 2018, the Supreme Court appointed a panel to probe the "harrowing" arrest and alleged torture of Narayanan. A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice Dipak Misra also awarded Mr. Narayanan Rs. 50 lakh in compensation for the "mental cruelty" he suffered all these years.The same month, Narayanan's name was recommended for Padma awards by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, then a BJP member of parliament.In January 2019, Modi said that "it was an honour for his government to confer the Padma Bhushan on Nambi Narayanan".The case and the Padma award featured in BJP's campaign for 2019 Indian general election,with Modi asking "I hope you are aware what the Congress has done to Kerala's own scientist Nambi Narayan" in a rally in Thiruvananthapuram.</div>
